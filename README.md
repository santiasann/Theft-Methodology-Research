# Theft-Methodology-Research
research to compare between YOLO and VGG 19 algorithm to detect theft action. The YOLO algorithm use YOLO version 5 as the model because it have more small computation rather than the new version as YOLO version 8 and YOLo version 9. As the VGG 19 algorithm, we use pre trained model from Tensorflow that using dataset ImageNet, and we train with new parameter using the same dataset as YOLO model. The dataset we use is collaborated images from UCF crime dataset, weapon detection dataset, one video about theft action on ATM by Youtube, and snacthing images from Roboflow.
